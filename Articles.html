                <h3><i>By Becky Potter</i></h3>
                <p> few weeks ago, I had a panic attack. It was the first time in my life that I had experienced such unfamiliar feelings of intense fear and debilitating terror. As each prolonged minute painfully elapsed, I honestly thought that I was dying.</p>
                <p>At the time, of course, I had no idea what was happening to my body.</p>

                <p>I did not know why my heart was racing, why my face was numb, or why my tongue felt like it was choking me. Why my hands and feet were tingling, why my arms felt heavy, why my head was spinning. Or why I felt absolutely certain that my body was shutting down.<a href="https://tinybuddha.com/blog/how-to-be-kind-to-yourself-in-a-busy-world/" style="font-size: larger;">click here</a></p>
